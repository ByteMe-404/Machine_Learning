# Data Profiling with ydata-profiling (formerly pandas-profiling)

`ydata-profiling` (previously known as `pandas-profiling`) creates an automated, detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report from a single pandas `DataFrame`.  
It produces an interactive HTML report with summaries, distributions, missing-value analysis, correlations, and more â€” great for a one-line EDA. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Quick install
Use pip (recommended) or conda:

```bash
pip install -U ydata-profiling
