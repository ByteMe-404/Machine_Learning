# What is EDA?

**EDA** stands for **Exploratory Data Analysis**.  
Itâ€™s the process of **exploring and understanding the dataset** before applying any machine learning or statistical models.  

The goal is simple: **get to know the data.**  
Just like a doctor does a basic check-up before treatment, EDA is a check-up for the dataset.

## Why do EDA?
- To **understand whatâ€™s in the data** (size, shape, types of values).  
- To **spot problems** like missing values, duplicates, or strange outliers.  
- To **see patterns** that could be useful for prediction.  
- To **decide next steps**: cleaning, feature engineering, or even changing the problem definition.

## Typical Steps in EDA
1. **Basic info** â†’ How big is the dataset (rows & columns)? What are the column names?  
2. **Preview data** â†’ Look at a few random rows with `.sample()` to get a quick feel.  
3. **Data types** â†’ Identify numeric, categorical, text, or datetime columns.  
4. **Missing values** â†’ Check how many values are missing and where.  
5. **Summary stats** â†’ Mean, median, min, max, standard deviation.  
6. **Duplicates** â†’ See if rows repeat unnecessarily.  
7. **Correlations** â†’ Spot relationships between numeric columns.  
8. **Visualizations** â†’ Use histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots to see distributions and patterns.

## Quick Analogy
- Think of EDA as **meeting a new person**.  
- You first ask basic questions (name, age, background).  
- Then you notice patterns (hobbies, interests).  
- You might also spot red flags (inconsistencies, missing info).  
- Only after knowing them well do you make decisions (like whether you want to work together).
