# üì• Data Fetching in Machine Learning

Before building any Machine Learning model, the most important step is to **fetch (collect) data**.  
Data is the **fuel** of ML ‚Äî without good data, even the best algorithm will fail.

## üîé What is Data Fetching?
**Data Fetching** is the process of gathering raw data from different sources and bringing it into a usable format for analysis and training ML models.

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Sources of Data

1. **Databases**
   - SQL Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)  
   - NoSQL Databases (MongoDB, Cassandra)  
   - Example: Fetching customer purchase history from a retail database.

2. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**
   - Many platforms provide data via APIs.  
   - Example: Twitter API for tweets, OpenWeather API for weather data.

3. **Web Scraping**
   - Extracting data from websites using tools like **BeautifulSoup, Scrapy**.  
   - Example: Scraping product reviews from e-commerce sites.

4. **Open Datasets**
   - Publicly available datasets for learning and research:  
     - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)  
     - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)  
     - [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)  

5. **Sensors / IoT Devices**
   - Data collected from real-world devices (temperature sensors, fitness trackers).  
   - Example: Smartwatch tracking heart rate and steps.

6. **Logs & User Interaction Data**
   - Collected from software applications, websites, or apps.  
   - Example: Clickstream data from a website.
