# üåê Online vs Offline Machine Learning

Machine Learning models can be trained in **two main ways**: **Offline (Batch) Learning** and **Online Learning**. Both have different characteristics and use cases.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Offline (Batch) Machine Learning

**Definition:**  
Offline learning, also called **batch learning**, is when the ML model is trained **once on the entire dataset**. The model does not update continuously; it only learns when retrained on a new batch of data.  

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Trains on the **full dataset at once**  
- Model is **static** until retrained  
- Works well for **stable datasets**  

**Advantages:**  
- High accuracy, since it uses the **entire dataset**  
- Easier to test and validate  
- Suitable for complex models  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Cannot handle **real-time data** efficiently  
- Retraining is time-consuming for large datasets  

**Example Applications:**  
- Predicting house prices using historical data  
- Credit scoring based on past transactions  
- Image recognition using a fixed labeled dataset

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Online Machine Learning

**Definition:**  
Online learning is when the ML model **updates continuously** as new data arrives. The model learns **incrementally** and adapts to changes in real-time.  

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Trains **incrementally** with each new data point  
- Model is **dynamic and adaptive**  
- Suitable for **streaming or evolving data**  

**Advantages:**  
- Can handle **real-time applications**  
- Adapts to **changing data patterns**  
- Requires **less memory** since it processes data in chunks  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Can be less stable if the **data is noisy**  
- May require careful tuning to avoid forgetting old knowledge  

**Example Applications:**  
- Spam detection in emails  
- Stock price prediction  
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, YouTube) adapting to user behavior  
- Fraud detection in real-time transactions
