# 🧠 What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that teaches computers to **learn from data** instead of following step-by-step instructions.

## 🔑 Key Ideas
- **Learning from Data**: ML finds patterns in data.
- **Improvement Over Time**: More data = better results.
- **Generalization**: Works well on new, unseen data.

## 🍎 Example: Learning Fruits
- Show robot many **apples** 🍎 → “This is an apple”
- Show robot many **bananas** 🍌 → “This is a banana”
- Robot learns to recognize new fruits.

## 🌍 Where Do We See ML?
- Video recommendations (YouTube, Netflix)
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Self-driving cars
- Spam detection
