# üîÑ Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)

The **Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)** is a systematic process that guides how ML projects are developed, deployed, and maintained.  
It ensures models are built efficiently, accurately, and sustainably.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Stages of the ML Life Cycle

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Definition
- Understand the **business problem** or research question.
- Define **objectives**, **success metrics**, and expected outcomes.
- Example: Predict customer churn, detect spam, or forecast sales.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection
- Gather raw data from various sources:  
  - Databases  
  - APIs  
  - Web scraping  
  - IoT devices  
- Ensure enough **quantity** and **quality** of data.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Clean and transform raw data into usable form:
  - Handle **missing values**
  - Remove **duplicates**
  - Normalize/standardize features
  - Encode categorical variables
- Split dataset into **train**, **validation**, and **test sets**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explore dataset to find **patterns, trends, and anomalies**.
- Use **statistics and visualization** (histograms, correlation heatmaps).
- Identify important features and potential biases.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection
- Choose the right algorithm based on problem type:
  - **Classification** ‚Üí Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks  
  - **Regression** ‚Üí Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
  - **Clustering** ‚Üí k-Means, DBSCAN  
- Consider trade-offs (accuracy, speed, interpretability).

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- Train the model using training data.
- Optimize **parameters (weights)** using techniques like **gradient descent**.
- Use **cross-validation** to prevent overfitting.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics:
  - Classification ‚Üí Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
  - Regression ‚Üí RMSE, MAE, R¬≤ Score  
- Compare with baseline models to check improvements.

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning
- Adjust hyperparameters to improve model performance:
  - Learning rate, batch size, number of layers, depth of trees
- Techniques: **Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization**

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Model Deployment
- Deploy the trained model into production:
  - REST APIs, Web Apps, Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- Ensure scalability, latency, and security.

---

### üîü Monitoring & Maintenance
- Continuously monitor model performance after deployment.
- Detect **data drift** or **concept drift**.
- Update/retrain models as new data becomes available.

## ‚ú® Key Takeaway
Machine Learning projects are not **one-time tasks**.  
They are **iterative cycles** that require continuous monitoring, retraining, and improvement.
