## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Definition:**  
AI is the field of computer science that focuses on creating **machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence**. It combines human-like thinking with algorithms to mimic cognitive functions.  

**Key Skills of AI:**  
- **Learning** ‚Äì acquiring knowledge from data or experience  
- **Reasoning** ‚Äì making logical decisions based on information  
- **Self-correction** ‚Äì improving performance over time  

**Examples of AI Applications:**  
- Speech recognition (Siri, Alexa)  
- Autonomous vehicles (self-driving cars)  
- Predictive maintenance in industry  
- Personalized recommendations (Netflix, Amazon)  
- Fraud detection in banking  
- Game-playing AI (Chess, Go, Poker)

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning (ML)

**Definition:**  
Machine Learning is a **subset of AI** that enables computers to **learn from data and improve performance automatically** without explicit programming. ML identifies patterns in data to make predictions or decisions.  

**Types of ML:**  
- **Supervised Learning:** Learn from labeled data (e.g., predicting house prices)  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Learn from unlabeled data to find patterns (e.g., customer segmentation)  
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learn by trial and error using rewards and penalties (e.g., game-playing AI)  

**Examples of ML Applications:**  
- Image recognition  
- Email spam filters  
- Recommendation systems  
- Predictive maintenance  
- Credit risk assessment  
- Customer segmentation  
- Fraud detection  
- Speech recognition

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deep Learning (DL)

**Definition:**  
Deep Learning is a **subset of ML** that uses **artificial neural networks with multiple layers** to mimic the human brain. DL automatically extracts features from raw data to make highly accurate predictions.  

**Characteristics of DL:**  
- Works with **large datasets**  
- Learns **complex patterns** automatically  
- Uses **layered neural networks** to process information hierarchically  

**Types of Neural Networks in DL:**  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) ‚Äì image/video recognition  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) ‚Äì sequential data like text and speech  
- Recursive Neural Networks ‚Äì hierarchical structures  
- Unsupervised Pre-trained Networks ‚Äì feature extraction without labels  

**Examples of DL Applications:**  
- Image and video recognition  
- Speech recognition  
- Natural language processing (translation, sentiment analysis)  
- Autonomous vehicles  
- Recommender systems  
- Fraud detection  
- Game-playing AI (AlphaGo)  
- Time series forecasting (stock prices, weather patterns)
