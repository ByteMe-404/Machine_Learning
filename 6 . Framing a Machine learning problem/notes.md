# Framing a Machine Learning Problem

This guide is my personal way of thinking about how to frame a machine learning (ML) problem.  
It’s not just about picking an algorithm — it’s about making sure I clearly understand **what I want to solve, what data I have, and how I’ll measure success.**

## 1. Be Clear on the Goal  
I always start with the actual problem.  

👉 **Question:** What am I trying to achieve?  
Examples:  
- Predict if a customer will leave (churn).  
- Detect if a transaction is fraud.  
- Forecast sales for the next month.  

This step prevents me from building models “just because I can.”

## 2. Figure Out Inputs and Outputs  
- **Inputs (features):** The things I can use to make a prediction.  
  *Example: past purchases, age, sensor readings, text, images.*  
  > *Feature = a measurable thing about each example.*  

- **Output (label/target):** The thing I want to predict.  
  *Example: churn (yes/no), house price (a number), or product category.*  

If the output can’t be defined, ML may not be the right tool.

## 3. Decide the Type of Problem  
Depending on the output, I can classify the ML problem:  
- **Classification** → Predict categories (spam vs not spam).  
- **Regression** → Predict numbers (house price).  
- **Clustering** → Group things without labels (customer segments).  
- **Reinforcement Learning** → Learn through trial and error (like teaching a robot to walk).

## 4. Pick a Way to Measure Success  
I need a clear way to evaluate the model:  

- **Accuracy** → % of predictions that are correct.  
- **Precision** → When the model predicts "yes," how often is it correct?  
- **Recall** → Out of all the actual "yes" cases, how many did it catch?  
- **RMSE/MAE** → Metrics for how far off number predictions are.  

💡 Best practice: choose a metric that connects to the real-world goal (e.g., reducing churn, increasing revenue).

## 5. Think About Constraints  
Questions I ask before building:  
- Do I have enough good-quality data?  
- Does the model need to work in **real-time** (fast, like fraud detection)?  
- Do people need to **understand the model’s reasoning** (important in healthcare)?  
- Do I have enough computing power and time to train it?  

---

## 6. Set a Baseline  
Before making anything fancy, I check the simplest possible solution:  
- Predicting the most common class (e.g., “everyone will stay”).  
- Predicting the average (e.g., mean house price).  
- Rule-based heuristics (e.g., “if amount > $1000, flag as fraud”).  

👉 The ML model should clearly outperform this baseline.

---

## 7. Plan for Deployment and Monitoring  
Finally, I ask: how will this model live in the real world?  
- Will it run daily, hourly, or instantly?  
- Will predictions change user behavior (causing data drift)?  
- Do I have monitoring to check performance over time?

## ✅ My Checklist  
- [ ] What’s the goal?  
- [ ] What are the inputs and outputs?  
- [ ] What type of ML problem is it?  
- [ ] How will I measure success?  
- [ ] What are the real-world constraints?  
- [ ] What’s the baseline performance?  
- [ ] How will it be deployed and monitored?

📌 *This document is meant to keep me (and others) focused on framing ML problems correctly before diving into coding. A well-framed problem often matters more than the model itself.*
