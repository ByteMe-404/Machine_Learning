# 📏 Feature Scaling

**Feature Scaling** is the process of bringing all numeric features to the same scale (range or distribution).  
Many Machine Learning algorithms are sensitive to differences in magnitude — a column measured in kilometers may dominate one measured in centimeters.

## 🔹 Why Feature Scaling?
- Ensures **fair comparison** between features.  
- Makes **gradient descent converge faster** (used in Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks).  
- Required for **distance-based algorithms** (KNN, K-Means, PCA, SVM).  
- Not always needed for **tree-based models** (Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).

## 🔹 Common Methods

### 1. Min-Max Scaling (Normalization)
Rescales values to a **fixed range [0, 1]**.  

Formula:  
\[
x' = \frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}
\]

Example:  
- Height range: 150–200 cm.  
- A value of 175 → \((175 - 150) / (200 - 150) = 0.5\).

### 2. Standardization (Z-score Scaling)
Centers data around **mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1**.  

Formula:  
\[
x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Example:  
- Exam score = 85, mean = 70, std = 10.  
- \( (85 - 70) / 10 = 1.5 \) → 1.5 standard deviations above average.

### 3. Robust Scaling
Uses **median and IQR (Interquartile Range)** → less sensitive to outliers.  

Formula:  
\[
x' = \frac{x - \text{median}}{\text{IQR}}
\]

Good for datasets with extreme values.

### 4. Log / Power Transform
- Apply **log, square root, or Box-Cox transform** to reduce skewness.  
- Useful when features have exponential growth (e.g., income, population).

## 🔹 Quick Analogy
Scaling is like **converting different currencies to the same unit** 💵💶💴 before comparing them.  
Without scaling, one feature could unfairly dominate because of its bigger numbers.
